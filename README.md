# Criminal-Investigation-RMS
An open source project to develop an investigation record management system.
We are developing an investigation tool that will allow users to interact with records of subjects/entities in the system. It will help the end user link entities to people and businesses.
- Entities will include (this list is not exhaustive)
 - People
 - Businesses
 - Exhibits
 - Documents
 - Statements
 - Interviews
 - Locations
 - Tasks
 - Messages
 - Accounts
 - Legal 
 
The system will have multiple user levels to aid the security of the system through permissions and also allow allocating, reporting and finalisation of cases. 

The system will be supplied to a range of institutes to help them manage cases that are criminal or civil.

We will be loading the initial build early 2021 and we are looking for open source developer and community help to build a world-class system.

We will be incorporating graphical software to graphically display links in networks. We will also be including links to communication software to enable the user to communicate with other users through multiple means. 

I look forward to your interactions on its development.
